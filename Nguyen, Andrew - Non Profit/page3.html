                <p>Operation Smile was founded in 1982 when Dr. William (Bill) P. Magee, Jr., a plastic surgeon, and his wife, Kathleen (Kathy), a nurse and clinical social worker, traveled to the Philippines with a group of medical volunteers to repair children's cleft lips and cleft palates. What they found was overwhelming. &quot;	People pushed their babies at us.&quot;	 recalls Kathy. &quot;	They tugged at our sleeves with tears in their eyes and begged us to help their children.&quot;	 In Naga City, approximately 300 families arrived hoping their children would receive surgery, but the team could only treat 40 children. As they prepared to leave, the Magees made a promise they would return to help more children. </p>
                
                <p>They began soliciting donations of surgical equipment and supplies from manufacturers, threw themselves into grassroots fundraising and assembled a volunteer team of 18 doctors, nurses and technicians for their own medical mission to the Philippines. They helped approximately 100 more patients, but again, hundreds still waited. <strong>They saw the need and Operation Smile was born.</strong></p>
