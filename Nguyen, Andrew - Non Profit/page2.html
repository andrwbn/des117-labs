                For too many families around the world, safe surgery is not an option. At Operation Smile we believe every child deserves exceptional surgical care. We believe all children deserve to be treated as if they were our own. That is what drives each and every one of us: our global network of medical professionals, who donate hundreds of thousands of hours toward the care of children around the world each year, and our supporters who are moved every day to make a difference in the lives of children they have never met. As long as there are children in the world who need our help, we'll do whatever it takes to give them the quality care they deserve.
